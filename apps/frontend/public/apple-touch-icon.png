# This is a placeholder for a 180x180 PNG icon for iOS devices
# In a real application, you would replace this with an actual PNG image file
# The 180x180 size is the standard for modern iOS devices

# You can create this using:
# 1. Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
# 2. Online favicon generators
# 3. Convert your existing SVG favicon to PNG format

# This file should be replaced with a proper PNG image
