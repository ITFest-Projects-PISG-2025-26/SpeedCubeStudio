# This is a placeholder for a 192x192 PNG icon
# In a real application, you would replace this with an actual PNG image file
# You can create this using design tools like Figma, Canva, or online favicon generators

# For now, you can use the SVG favicon as a reference and convert it to PNG format
# Or use online tools to generate proper PWA icons from your logo
